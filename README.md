A brief overview of what Morse code is:

Morse code is a method of encoding text characters using sequences of dots (·) and dashes (−). Each letter, number, and punctuation mark is represented by a unique combination of these signals. It was developed in the 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail for use in telegraphy, allowing messages to be sent over long distances using electrical signals or visual/audio signals like light or sound. Morse code played a crucial role in early communication technologies and is still used today in aviation, amateur radio, and emergency signaling.

The historical context of why morse code was created:

Morse code was created in the early 1830s as a solution to a major communication challenge of the time: long-distance messaging. Before its invention, communication over great distances was slow and unreliable, relying on physical transportation of messages by horse, ship, or train.
Samuel Morse, an American inventor and artist, developed Morse code alongside Alfred Vail as part of the electric telegraph system. The goal was to transmit messages quickly over telegraph wires using electrical pulses. Since early telegraph systems could only send simple signals (on/off), Morse code provided a way to represent letters and numbers using patterns of short and long signals (dots and dashes).
The development was driven by the growing need for faster communication during the Industrial Revolution, especially for business, journalism, and government. Morse code revolutionized global communication, enabling almost instant messaging across continents and laying the groundwork for modern telecommunications.

Explanation of how the Morse code system works, including the use dots and dashes:
Morse code is a system that represents letters, numbers, and punctuation using sequences of dots (·) and dashes (−). These are also called "dits" and "dahs" in audio transmission. Each character is encoded by a unique combination of these symbols.
How It Works:
A dot (·) is a short signal.


A dash (−) is a longer signal, typically three times the length of a dot.


Characters are separated by a short pause (usually the length of one dot).


Words are separated by a longer pause (typically the length of seven dots).



Examples:
A = · −


B = − · · ·


C = − · − ·


S = · · ·


O = − − −


So, the distress signal SOS is:
 · · · − − − · · ·
Transmission:
Morse code can be transmitted in various ways:
Sound (beeps or tones)


Light (flashes)


Visual signals (such as blinking)


Radio or telegraph lines


It’s especially useful in situations where voice communication isn't possible, such as in emergencies or when signal clarity is low.
